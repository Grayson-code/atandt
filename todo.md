Community Suggestions

-> App
- offline mode
- passive aggressive, uncanny motivation from a ghost character like duo

-> Main Dashboard
- make it ai powered like a planner that not only tracks due dates but also like suggests an optimal study schedule based on our study habits
- a priority system, where the most important stuff has biggest warnings and less important stuff has smaller warnings
- timetable that automatically switches for dual subjects on same period like cc/yoga or lib/art
- calendar/week range with varying degrees of hotness for amount of work

-> A mascot that is formless, yet gives uncanny motivation from around the app.
